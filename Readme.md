## Neural Network Implementation

This is a Neural Network implementation made for the Machine Learning Course. This implementation tries to use different optimization algorithms and different model selection techniques to compare them.

The project has been realized using Matlab


# Usage

To run this scripts it is necessary to add the data in a Matrix. The project is organized in folders with different implementations of the functions. You can find some Script examples in the main folder of the project.
