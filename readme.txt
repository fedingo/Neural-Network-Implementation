Project A with CM

- Nickname: ChocoPandas

==========================================================================

The project is divided in folders:
- Data: Monk's datasets, Cup dataset and Blind test dataset
- Gradient Descent Learning: script for the training with the Gradient Descent Learning
- Neural Network: feed forward and back propagation steps
- Polyak Learning: script for the training with the Polyak Learning
- Regularization L1: regularize function for L1
- Regularization L2: regularize function for L2

Then there are other scripts:
- CrossValidation
- Genetic_Model_Selection
- Random_Model_Selection
- AutoGrid_Model_Selection (for the automatized grid search)
- Model_Selection (for the Grid Search)
- RidgeRegression
- Search_Ridge (finds the best parameter for the regularization of the Ridge Regression)

The following scripts can be used to try the project:

NN
Cup:
- Cup_Grid_Script : Grid search
- Cup_Script: AutoGrid, Random and Genetic search

Monk's (used in the ML Project):
- Genetic_Script: Genetic search
- Grid_Script: Grid search
- Template_Script: Random search

LMS
- RidgeRegression(alpha): Ridge Regression on the Cup Dataset
